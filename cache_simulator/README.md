# Cache Simulator
This code is a cache simulator written in C. It simulates a cache's behavior by replaying memory access traces, typically from tools like Valgrind, and outputs statistics about cache hits, misses, and evictions. The simulator uses the Least Recently Used (LRU) policy for cache replacement.
