# Dymanic Memory Allocator
This code is a custom memory allocator for heap management in C. The allocator uses a block-based approach with headers and footers to manage free and allocated memory. 
It includes functions for initializing the heap, allocating and freeing memory, coalasing adjacent free blocks, and displaying the heap's status.
